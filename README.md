**Life's Lessons - Where Every Experience Becomes Wisdom**

**Purpose**
Life’s Lessons is designed to help people capture, organize, and preserve the meaningful wisdom they gain throughout their lives. We often learn powerful lessons from experiences, but with time, we forget them. This application provides a personal digital space to write, save, and reflect on those insights anytime.

It also allows users to explore lessons shared by others, discover new perspectives, and grow through community-driven wisdom. Whether it’s personal growth, emotional healing, or motivation, Life’s Lessons helps people learn, remember, and stay inspired.
